Without it, Codes are never complete. So, rather than keeping the conventional Coding Contest, this time Programming Club is back in action with its new Event - Code Bug 1.0. The Details of the Event are:\n\u00b7         This will be a Testing contest where you will be given a set of problems and their codes and you need to find bugs present in the code.\n\n\u00b7         Code of the problems will be in either C or C++.\n\n\u00b7         This is a team event. A maximum of 2 participants can participate in a team.\n\n\u00b7         Date, Time and Venue: 23rd February, 2014 Sunday 2:30 pm at Mess Basement, Silver Springs\n\n\u00b7         Laptops are not allowed in the Contest. We will provide you the hard copy of problem set in which you need to modify the code.\n\n\n\nWe hope to see you there\u2026\nRegards,\nProgramming Club\n \nFor Details Contact:\n\nSai Nath: +91-9407406691\nKrishna Chaitanya: +91-9407406691\nSreemathi Basker: +91-9993261335\nUtkarsh Saxena: +91-9415552327", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/events/718897884826904/", "created_time": "2014-02-22T15:29:07+0000", "type": "event", "name": "Code Bug 1.0", "id": "535072939920705_718897884826904", "comments": {"data": [], "summary": {"order": "chronological", "total_count": 0, "can_comment": false}}, "reactions": {"data": [], "summary": {"total_count": 1, "viewer_reaction": "NONE"}}}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/pclubiiti/photos/a.579565548804777.1073741827.535072939920705/579565398804792/?type=3", "created_time": "2014-02-22T15:18:08+0000", "type": "photo", "name": "Programming Club, IIT Indore's cover photo", "id": "535072939920705_579565562138109", "comments": {"data": [], "summary": {"order": "ranked", "total_count": 0, "can_comment": false}}, "reactions": {"data": [], "summary": {"total_count": 6, "viewer_reaction": "NONE"}}}], "paging": {"cursors": {"before": "Q2c4U1pXNTBYM0YxWlhKNVgzTjBiM0o1WDJsa0R5UTFNelV3TnpJNU16azVNakEzTURVNkxUYzRNVFU1TWprME9UZAzJOekF6TXpRd05qVVBER0ZA3YVY5emRHOXllVjlwWkE4ZA05UTTFNRGN5T1RNNU9USXdOekExWHpFMk9UTXpNalEyTmpBM05qSXhPRGdQQkhScGJXVUdXaVJGTkFFPQZDZD", "after": "Q2c4U1pXNTBYM0YxWlhKNVgzTjBiM0o1WDJsa0R5UTFNelV3TnpJNU16azVNakEzTURVNkxUTXpOakU1T0RRMk56ZA3pPVEEwTVRBeE16ZA1BER0ZA3YVY5emRHOXllVjlwWkE4ZAk5UTTFNRGN5T1RNNU9USXdOekExWHpVM09UVTJOVFUyTWpFek9ERXdPUThFZAEdsdFpRWlRDTCt3QVE9PQZDZD"}}}
